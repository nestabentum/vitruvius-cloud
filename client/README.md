# Vitruvius Cloud - Frontend

This part contains the frontend of Vitruvius Cloud IDE shown in the browser.

## Prerequisites

1. Install [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) and node
2. Install node 16 `nvm install 16`, use node 16 `nvm use 16`
3. Install `yarn npm install -g yarn`

## Developing with the browser example

1. Start watching the browser app via

        yarn watch

    This command watches for changes within the browser app and rebuilds it, e.g. this is the
    case whenever the coffee-editor-changes finished rebuilding, as the browser has a dependency
    on the extension. Note that rebuilding the browser app might take a couple of seconds. You can
    verify that it finished building the browser-app by looking at the hash of the bundle generated by
    webpack

2. Start the browser app with:

          cd browser-app && yarn start

    This start the browser app on <http://localhost:3000>

**NOTE**: The browser does not reload automatically whenever you changed something, you need to reload yourself currently.
